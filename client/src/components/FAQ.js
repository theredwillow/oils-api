          <h2 className="question">Why did you start myBlendology?</h2>
          <h3 className="answer">
            Frankly, we love essential oils and believe that everyone should
            have the ability to create basic blends without having to memorize
            the knowledge behind each oil. We hope this application can help
            beginners figure out what works for them and get them started with
            their essential oil journey!
          </h3>

          <h2 className="question">What makes up an essential oil blend?</h2>
          <h3 className="answer">
            We believe in the idea that any blend is comprised of a top, middle,
            and base note oil that will help balance the profiles of each oil.
            While this is by no means the only way to create an essential oil
            blend, we believe that this simple method will allow beginners to
            experiment with their own blend creations.
          </h3>

          <h2 className="question">Will your blends cure X, Y, and Z? </h2>
          <h3 className="answer">
            myBlendology is not offering any medical advice and is only offering
            suggestions for oil blends that users can enjoy in their own time.
            We recommend that any user of myBlendology confirms the use of any
            of these oils with a doctor.
